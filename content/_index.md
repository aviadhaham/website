# Greetings
<br/><br/>

- I'm Aviad Haham, a DevOps Engineer and a purist at heart, with a passion for anything that involves technology.

- I'm a "Certified Kubernetes Administrator", "Certified Linux Administrator", "Certified AWS Cloud Practitioner", and more.

- At present, I am employed as a DevOps Engineer with [Nexxen](https://nexxen.com).

- This site serves as a digital journal for my learnings, insights and experiences.
It's also a showcase for the projects I've worked on in my free time, both past and present.
